This RAT was created by H-zz-H.

If you have any questions or need assistance, you can reach me on Discord: h_zz_h or join my server: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/29Ya4F3CgQ).

As of February 23, 2025, I have posted a cracked open-source Discord Stealer in my Discord server. Normally, this would cost over €120 for lifetime access.

## Skidded Sources

I’ve used some code from the following sources:

- [Blank Grabber](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber) – The !blocklist and !unblocklist commands are almost fully skidded, with some modifications to fit my project. 🔄
- [Discord-RAT by moom825](https://github.com/moom825/Discord-RAT) – This project inspired me to start mine. Special thanks to moom825. 👏
- [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) – The !floatpic !cd and !list commands are ChatGPT generated 🙄

The !uncritproc and !critproc commands are directly from moom825’s RAT. 💻

Many features are similar because I needed working implementations, and his GitHub page was full of great ideas. 💡

## Final Words

Thanks for taking the time to read this. ❤️
