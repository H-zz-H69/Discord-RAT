## Skidded Sources

I’ve used some code from the following sources:

- [Blank Grabber](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber) – The !blocklist and !unblocklist commands are almost fully skidded, with some modifications to fit my project. 🔄
- [Discord-RAT by moom825](https://github.com/moom825/Discord-RAT) – This project inspired me to start mine. Special thanks to moom825. 👏
- [Roblox Stealer](https://github.com/Ramona-Flower/Roblox-Client-Cookie-Stealer/tree/main) - Completely stolen 💙❤💙
- [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) – The !floatpic !cd !floatpic !rec commands and !list commands are ChatGPT generated 🙄

The !uncritproc and !critproc commands are directly from moom825’s RAT. 💻

Many features are similar because I needed working implementations, and his GitHub page was full of great ideas. 💡

Love y’all. Bye. 👋
