**About This RAT**


This RAT was created by H-zz-H.


If you have any questions or need assistance, you can reach me on Discord: h_zz_h or join my server: [Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/29Ya4F3CgQ)


As of February 23, 2025, I have posted a cracked open-source Discord Stealer in my Discord server. Normally, this would cost over €120 for lifetime access.

Skidded Sources


I’ve used some code from the following sources:

[Blank Grabber](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber) – The !blocklist and !unblocklist commands are almost fully skidded, with some modifications to fit my project.


[Discord-RAT by moom825](https://github.com/moom825/Discord-RAT) – This project inspired me to start mine. Special thanks to moom825.


The !uncritproc and !critproc commands are directly from moom825’s RAT.


Many features are similar because I needed working implementations, and his GitHub page was full of great ideas.


Final Words


Thanks for taking the time to read this.




Love y’all. Bye.
