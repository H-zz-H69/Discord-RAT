# On my Discord server (as of 23.02.2025), I have posted a cracked open-source Discord Stealer that would normally cost more than 120 euros for lifetime access.  
# Join my Discord server for coding help or if you encounter errors with this RAT. I am always open to new ideas, projects, or feature suggestions for this RAT.  
# If you want to add new features or improve this RAT, feel free to do so and share your work with me on Discord.  
# If I find the time, this RAT will be updated and working forever. If not, well, I don't know.  
# If you use this RAT for illegal purposes, I am not responsible for it. I am also not responsible for any damage caused by this RAT.  
# Skid from this project if you want, I don’t really care lol. Just don’t claim it as your own work.  

# Sources I skidded from:  
# https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber (The !blocklist and !unblocklist commands are almost fully skidded. I just changed the code a bit to fit my project).  
# Tried doing it on my own (but I’m way too retarded for that).
# https://github.com/moom825/Discord-RAT (Because of this RAT, I started this project. So special thanks to moom825).  
# The !uncritproc and !critproc commands are from moom825's Discord-RAT project. Many features are quite the same as in moom825's project.  
# That’s because I needed some features I could code, and his GitHub page was full of ideas to implement.  
# Almost everything in this project is inspired by him.  

# Thanks for taking the time to read.  
# Love y’all. Bye.
